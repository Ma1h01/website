# Yihao Mai's Personal Website

## Notes
1. When develop and run the website locally, the 'homepage' attribute in the package.json file would change our root directory, thus we can not access the image inside the public/images folder
2. When deployed to GitHub Page, make sure to add the 'homepage' attribute
3. "homepage": "https://ma1h01.github.io/website",
